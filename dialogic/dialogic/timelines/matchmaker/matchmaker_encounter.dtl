MC: (Another figureâ€¦ slow steps, graceful hands.)
MC: (The Matchmaker. I haven't seen her since the wedding that never happened.)
Matchmaker: Oh, little gatekeeper... You've grown.
Matchmaker: I always said you'd have the eyes of a poet. Full of ache.
MC: (...Still smiling. Still measuring every word.)
Matchmaker: What a lonely post for one so young.
MC: You knew I hated crowds. You kept pairing me with strangers.
Matchmaker: And yet... they never hated *you*.
MC: (...She meddled. But people listened to her. Trusted her.)
Matchmaker: Tell me, do you still believe in love?
MC: What does that have to do with anything?
Matchmaker: Everything. That's why I'm here, isn't it?
