MC: You once gave me thread when my satchel burst. Didn't ask for anything in return.
Weaver: I remember. You tried to fix it with a twig before that.
MC: It held for a while.
Weaver: Long enough for a child to feel proud. That mattered.
MC: You never talked much about your own children.
Weaver: I lost them too young... before I had the words.
MC: I'm sorry.
Weaver: No need. You listened, even when I said nothing. That was enough.
MC: You may pass now. Thank you... for everything.
Weaver: Then I go, thread by thread, toward the next life.
