MC: (Another figure through the mist...)
MC: (She walks slowly. A shawl... that threadbare cloth...)
MC: (Is that the Weaver?)
Weaver: My, how the mist clings to this place... like a child refusing to let go.
Weaver: Youâ€”look at you. Taller than I remember. But the eyes... still searching.
MC: (Her voice... I remember it from the evenings. She used to hum when she worked.)
MC: You used to sit outside, didn't you? Mending robes while the sun went down.
Weaver: A habit of old hands. The light was good then.
Weaver: I still recall how you once brought me a torn sash, pretending it was your father's.
MC: I... I don't remember that.
Weaver: Mm. Maybe I imagined it. Or maybe you did.
MC: (...She always had a quiet way. Like she saw more than she said.)
