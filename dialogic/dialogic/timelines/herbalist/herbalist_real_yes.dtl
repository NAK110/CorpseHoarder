MC: I remember now. You always sat on that stone bench. By the plums.
Herbalist: That's right. Didn't say much. But I saw everything.
MC: You taught me which plants to avoid. Just with a nod.
Herbalist: Heh... Didn't think you'd recall.
Herbalist: Thank you. For choosing to see me, even now.
MC: Go in peace, sir.
Herbalist: May your roots grow steady, child.
