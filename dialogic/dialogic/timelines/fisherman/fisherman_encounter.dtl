MC: (Broad shoulders. Bare arms. That scent—salt and smoke...)
MC: (...The Fisherman?)
Fisherman: You've built quite the gate here, boy.
Fisherman: Strong frame. Good wood. Won't rot easy.
MC: (...He used to say that about his boats.)
Fisherman: You remember me?
MC: I used to wait at the pier for scraps. You'd never say a word—just threw the bones my way.
Fisherman: Hmph. Dogs bark. Fish don't. I liked quiet.
MC: You pulled a child out of the flood once. Didn't even take credit.
Fisherman: That boy had no business chasing frogs in a monsoon.
MC: (...That *was* him. Wasn't it?)
