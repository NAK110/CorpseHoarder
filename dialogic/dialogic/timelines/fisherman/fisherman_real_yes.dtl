MC: You once said, "If the net tears, mend it. If the sea's angry, wait."
MC: I never forgot.
Fisherman: Thought you weren't listening. You never looked me in the eye.
MC: I was scared. You looked like the storm.
Fisherman: Good. Fear keeps the foolish alive.
MC: Thank you... for pulling me out that day.
Fisherman: Thank me by standing straight. Don't waver.
MC: You're free to pass.
Fisherman: Then I'll cast my line elsewhere. Calm waters, this time.
