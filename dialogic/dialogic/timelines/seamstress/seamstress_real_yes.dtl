MC: I remember... you stitched my uniform every year.
MC: You pricked your finger every time, but never complained.
Seamstress: Because you always grew too fast.
Seamstress: And I was always too slow to keep up.
MC: I tried to hate you. For leaving me. For dying.
Seamstress: Then hate me no longer.
Seamstress: You are strong. And I am proud.
MC: You can go now. Wherever your thread leads.
Seamstress: Then may yours not fray, my child.
