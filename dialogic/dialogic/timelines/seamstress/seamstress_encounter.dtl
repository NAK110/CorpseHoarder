MC: (So many have come through already...)
MC: (...Their faces familiar. Their voices worse.)
MC: (Each time, it's harder to remember what's real.)
MC: (Harder to tell if I was ever truly alive at all.)
MC: (The mist moves again.)
MC: (...No, it can't be—)
Seamstress: You're still here.
Seamstress: Still at that gate like a stubborn child.
MC: (...That voice... that posture... it's her.)
MC: (...It *looks* like her.)
Seamstress: All grown, and still frowning the same.
Seamstress: Just like your father.
MC: (Don't say that name.)
MC: (...She looks older than I remember.)
Seamstress: I suppose I should thank you.
Seamstress: For keeping vigil. For doing... whatever this is.
MC: What do you want?
Seamstress: Hmph. Still sharp.
Seamstress: I want nothing, child.
Seamstress: I only walked. And here you are.
MC: You were supposed to be gone.
Seamstress: Aren't we all?
Seamstress: But not all of us stay buried.
MC: ...
MC: Why now?
Seamstress: Maybe I missed you.
Seamstress: Or maybe the threads of karma knotted too tightly for me to stay away.
MC: (She used to say that. About karma.)
MC: (She used to say everything had a thread.)
Seamstress: You think me a ghost, don't you?
Seamstress: Or worse — one of those... *things* you push back into the mist.
MC: I don't know what I think.
Seamstress: Fair. You never liked my answers, anyway.
Seamstress: Not when I told you to study, or to stay away from the lake.
MC: You think this is the same?
Seamstress: Do you?
MC: (I remember the fire. The screaming. The door that wouldn't open.)
MC: (...Her hands pushing me out. Hers. Weren't they?)
Seamstress: Say it.
MC: Say what?
Seamstress: Say you don't trust me.
MC: (Why does it hurt so much just to look at her?)
MC: (Why do I *want* it to be her?)
Seamstress: Well?
