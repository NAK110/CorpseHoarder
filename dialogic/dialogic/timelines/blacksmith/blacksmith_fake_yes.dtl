Blacksmith: Hah. That forge burned with spite.
MC: You blamed the town. But you never said why.
Blacksmith: Because they let her die. You *all* did.
MC: Wait... that's not howâ€”
Blacksmith: Don't matter. Truth bends in the fire.
Blacksmith: You think you're sending me to peace? I'll see you again... in flames.
MC: You're not him.
Blacksmith: Then maybe you didn't know him at all.
